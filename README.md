# Meow Moo :D

Grew up playing 2-player Flash games as a kid, so I decided to create this for fun! 

# Game Features:
~ 2 Player game
~ Interact dynamically with the environment, such as collecting objects, dodging obstacles, or interacting with various in-game elements
~ Every round, there is one player that is "it"
~ Eating the poisons lowers speed, eating the peaches gains speed
~ Peaches and poisons regenerate after a certain amount is eaten
~ Animated characters
~ A scoring system based on the number of successive rounds won
~ A dashboard displaying score, speed, the player that is 'it'
~ Sound effects when you collect the gold coin and tag the other player
~ Gain invisibility for a few seconds by collecting the gold coin! 
~ Use crates as shields from the fighter cat and man
~ Colliding with the fighter cat and man nudge the player toward the center of the screen
~ Hitting the wall restarts the round

Still working on:
~ Adding AI smart characters (currently implementing A* algorithm)
~ Enhancing UI by adding background and customized & animated pixel characters
~ Adding a pause and sound toggle button on the dashboard
