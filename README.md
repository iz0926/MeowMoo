# Meow Moo :D

Grew up playing 2-player Flash games, so I decided to create this! Built using Java and Processing IDE

# Game Features:
~ 2 Player game <br>
~ Interact dynamically with the environment, such as collecting objects, dodging obstacles, or interacting with various in-game elements<br>
~ Every round, there is one player that is "it"<br>
~ Eating the poisons lowers speed, eating the peaches gains speed<br>
~ Peaches and poisons regenerate after a certain amount is eaten<br>
~ Animated characters<br>
~ A scoring system based on the number of successive rounds won<br>
~ A dashboard displaying score, speed, the player that is 'it'<br>
~ Sound effects when you collect the gold coin and tag the other player<br>
~ Gain invisibility for a few seconds by collecting the gold coin! <br>
~ Use crates as shields from the fighter cat and man<br>
~ Colliding with the fighter cat and man nudge the player toward the center of the screen<br>
~ Hitting the wall restarts the round<br>

Still working on:<br>
~ Adding AI smart characters (currently implementing A* algorithm)<br>
~ Enhancing UI by adding background and customized & animated pixel characters<br>
~ Adding a pause and sound toggle button on the dashboard <br>
